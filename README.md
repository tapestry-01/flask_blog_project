# Flask Blog Project 📝

Hello fellow developers,

This is my first project built as part of my internship with **SECT IP, Civora Nexus**. The goal was to create a simple, functional blog website using the **Flask web framework** in Python.

The blog allows:
- Users to view a list of posts
- Each post has its own page
- Admin access to create, edit, and delete posts

The UI is styled using **HTML** and **CSS**, keeping it minimal and readable. For content, I’ve included some of my own poems and a personal short piece — making this project not just technical, but personal.

I hope this serves well as a beginner project and as a foundation for more complex builds in the future.

This project was created as part of an internship task at SECT IP, Civora Nexus. Built with Flask (Python), HTML/CSS, and hosted on PythonAnywhere. Posts can be managed via an admin dashboard.


Thanks for checking it out!
